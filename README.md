These are auxiliary [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com) commands. Some are
provided by the community. Some are provided by RubyMotion proper.

I'm still trying to determine the best licence for these commands. The
intent is to make sure that better versions of these commands aren't
possible (meaning that the best versions of these commands are open).

That being said, RubyMotion does leverage the commands with its
proprietary LLVM frontend.

For now assume the following copyright until I figure out the best
license. And assume BSD-2 as the future license (there will be plenty
of warning if GPL is adopted).
